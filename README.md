# Music Battles Test



This application counts from 1 to 100 and outputs different messages depending on whether the number is a multiple of 3,5, both or none, all of this only using one if statement. For example:

  - Outputs "Music" if the number is a multiple of 3.
  - Outputs "IT" if the number is a multiple of 5.
  - Outputs "Musical" if the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5.
  - Outputs the number itself if it doesnÂ´t meet the rules above.
